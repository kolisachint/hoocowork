- **Interactive Chat Interface** - Built-in chat interface for seamless communication with the Agents
- **Integrated Shell Terminal** - Direct access to the Agents CLI through built-in shell functionality
- **File Explorer** - Interactive file tree with syntax highlighting and live editing
- **Git Explorer** - View, stage and commit your changes. You can also switch branches 
- **Session Management** - Resume conversations, manage multiple sessions, and track history
- **Plugin System** - Extend HooCowork with custom plugins — add new tabs, backend services, and integrations. [Build your own →](https://github.com/kolisachint/hoocowork-plugin-starter)
- **TaskMaster AI Integration** *(Optional)* - Advanced project management with AI-powered task planning, PRD parsing, and workflow automation
- **Model Compatibility** - Works with Claude, GPT, and Gemini model families (see [`shared/modelConstants.js`](shared/modelConstants.js) for the full list of supported models)


## Quick Start

### HooCowork (Recommended)

The fastest way to get started — no local setup required. Get a fully managed, containerized development environment accessible from the web, mobile app, API, or your favorite IDE.

**[Get started with HooCowork](https://hoocowork.app)**


### Self-Hosted (Open source)

#### npm

Try HooCowork UI instantly with **npx** (requires **Node.js** v22+):

```
npx @kolisachint/hoocowork
```

Or install **globally** for regular use:

```
npm install -g @kolisachint/hoocowork
hoocowork
```

Open `http://localhost:3001` — all your existing sessions are discovered automatically.

Visit the **[documentation →](https://hoocowork.app/docs)** for full configuration options, PM2, remote server setup and more.

#### Docker Sandboxes (Experimental)

Run agents in isolated sandboxes with hypervisor-level isolation. Starts Claude Code by default. Requires the [`sbx` CLI](https://docs.docker.com/ai/sandboxes/get-started/).

```
npx @kolisachint/hoocowork@latest sandbox ~/my-project
```

Supports Claude Code, Codex, and Gemini CLI. See the [sandbox docs](docker/) for setup and advanced options.

> CI/CD uses bun for faster builds. Install bun from https://bun.sh

#### Development

For local development:
- `npm run dev` - Start frontend and backend in dev mode
- `npm run build` or `bun run build` - Production build
- `npm test` or `bun test` - Run tests

Both `package-lock.json` and `bun.lock` are maintained in the repo.

## Which option is right for you?

HooCowork is the open source UI layer. You can self-host it on your own machine or run it in a Docker sandbox for isolation.

| | Self-Hosted (npm) | Self-Hosted (Docker Sandbox) *(Experimental)* |
|---|---|---|
| **Best for** | Local agent sessions on your own machine | Isolated agents with web/mobile IDE |
| **How you access it** | Browser via `[yourip]:port` | Browser via `localhost:port` |
| **Setup** | `npx @kolisachint/hoocowork` | `npx @kolisachint/hoocowork@latest sandbox ~/project` |
| **Isolation** | Runs on your host | Hypervisor-level sandbox (microVM) |
| **Machine needs to stay on** | Yes | Yes |
| **Mobile access** | Any browser on your network | Any browser on your network |
| **Agents supported** | Claude Code, Cursor CLI, Codex, Gemini CLI | Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI |
| **File explorer and Git** | Yes | Yes |
| **MCP configuration** | Synced with `~/.claude` | Managed via UI |
| **REST API** | Yes | Yes |
| **Platform cost** | Free, open source | Free, open source |

> All options use your own AI subscriptions (Claude, Cursor, etc.) — HooCowork provides the environment, not the AI.

## Security & Tools Configuration

**🔒 Important Notice**: All Claude Code tools are **disabled by default**. This prevents potentially harmful operations from running automatically.

### Enabling Tools

To use Claude Code's full functionality, you'll need to manually enable tools:

1. **Open Tools Settings** - Click the gear icon in the sidebar
2. **Enable Selectively** - Turn on only the tools you need
3. **Apply Settings** - Your preferences are saved locally

<div align="center">

![Tools Settings Modal](public/screenshots/tools-modal.png)
*Tools Settings interface - enable only what you need*

</div>

**Recommended approach**: Start with basic tools enabled and add more as needed. You can always adjust these settings later.

## Plugins

HooCowork has a plugin system that lets you add custom tabs with their own frontend UI and optional Node.js backend. Install plugins from git repos directly in **Settings > Plugins**, or build your own.

### Available Plugins

| Plugin | Description |
|---|---|
| **[Project Stats](https://github.com/kolisachint/hoocowork-plugin-starter)** | Shows file counts, lines of code, file-type breakdown, largest files, and recently modified files for your current project |
| **[Web Terminal](https://github.com/kolisachint/hoocowork-plugin-terminal)** | Full xterm.js terminal with multi-tab support|
| **[HooCowork Scheduler](https://github.com/grostim/hoocowork-cron)** | Create workspace-scoped scheduled prompts and execute them through a local CLI such as Codex, Claude Code, or Gemini CLI|
### Build Your Own

**[Plugin Starter Template →](https://github.com/kolisachint/hoocowork-plugin-starter)** — fork this repo to create your own plugin. It includes a working example with frontend rendering, live context updates, and RPC communication to a backend server.

**[Plugin Documentation →](https://hoocowork.app/docs/plugin-overview)** — full guide to the plugin API, manifest format, security model, and more.

## FAQ

<details>
<summary>How is this different from Claude Code Remote Control?</summary>

Claude Code Remote Control lets you send messages to a session already running in your local terminal. Your machine has to stay on, your terminal has to stay open, and sessions time out after roughly 10 minutes without a network connection.

HooCowork extends Claude Code rather than sit alongside it — your MCP servers, permissions, settings, and sessions are the exact same ones Claude Code uses natively. Nothing is duplicated or managed separately.

Here's what that means in practice:

- **All your sessions, not just one** — HooCowork auto-discovers every session from your `~/.claude` folder. Remote Control only exposes the single active session to make it available in the Claude mobile app.
- **Your settings are your settings** — MCP servers, tool permissions, and project config you change in HooCowork are written directly to your Claude Code config and take effect immediately, and vice versa.
- **Works with more agents** — Claude Code, Cursor CLI, Codex, and Gemini CLI, not just Claude Code.
- **Full UI, not just a chat window** — file explorer, Git integration, MCP management, and a shell terminal are all built in.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Do I need to pay for an AI subscription separately?</summary>

Yes. HooCowork provides the environment, not the AI. You bring your own Claude, Cursor, Codex, or Gemini subscription.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I use HooCowork on my phone?</summary>

Yes. Run the server on your machine and open `[yourip]:port` in any browser on your network. A native app is also in the works.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Will changes I make in the UI affect my local Claude Code setup?</summary>

Yes, for self-hosted. HooCowork reads from and writes to the same `~/.claude` config that Claude Code uses natively.
